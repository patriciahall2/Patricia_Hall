    <h4>My Adventures In Coding</h4>
    <p>Hello:) I'm Patricia, a novice computer programmer. This January 2016 I began classes at
    <a href="http://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a>, a computer programming school
    in Portland, Oregon.</p>
    <p>Previous to attending these classes I had almost no
    experience with coding. I've been attending the Part-Time Intro to Coding
    courses for one month now.  This month we have been focusing on the
    basics of command line, how to use text editors, the basic language of HTML
    and CSS, how to apply boilerplates, the importance of using Git and GitHub
    for managing your projects, and more.</p>
    <p>I still have a lot to learn, but I am very impressed
    with how much I've learned already. This page will demonstrate my abilities
    in HTML and CSS language. Below is a list of pages where you can view my work.</p>
