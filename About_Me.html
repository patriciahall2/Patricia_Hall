      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p><strong>Hi. My name is Patricia Hall</strong>.</p>
      <p> I am new to computer programming. I began
      taking coding classes at <a href="http://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a>
      at the beginning of January 2016.</p>
      <p> I currently work at <a href="http://www.thejasminepearl.com/">The Jasmine
      Pearl</a>, a tea shop in <span class="green">Portland, Oregon</span> where I
      am the editor of the shop's social media, blog, and newsletters. I decided
      to take coding classes because I want to make our web presense more impressive
      in terms of styling and be able to create webpages that are more interesting
      and user-friendly to our customers. I do not have a formal education in
      digital editing or marketing.</p>
      <p>Outside of work I write and perform electronic music. I was a songwriter,
      synth player, and singer of a music project called
      <a href="http://www.capturedtracks.com/?ct_artist_page=softmetals">Soft Metals</a>
      from 2009 until 2015. In my free time I have been working on a new music
      project called <em>Patricia et Cameron</em>, which is currently in its writing stage.</p>
      <p>I have toured extensively with <em>Soft Metals</em>. Traveling and
      sharing my music with others around the world has been one of the most
      rewarding experiences of my life. I hope to eventually incorporate coding
      in my music as well.</p>
